# Duck Google!
Duck Google! politely asks you if you would like to visit DuckDuckGo instead
when you erroneously visit Google (or another major search engine).

## Ignoring Domains
If for some reason you decide that you don't want Duck Google! to ask
to redirect you when you for example visit, Ecosia, you can configure an
exception.
1. In a chrome browser navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Find Duck Google! and go to 'Details' > 'Extension Options'

To ignore a new domain, find the ignore domains section, type a domain
and click ignore.  The new domain should appear in the ignored domains list.
To remove a domain from the ignored domains, simply click remove.

## Developer Installation
1. In a chrome browser navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Make sure the 'Developer Mode' checkbox is selected in the right hand
   corner.
3. Select 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the root folder of this
   project, `duck_google`.
